						From a young age, I have always tinkered with computers—starting with learning BASIC on my Atari 400 and crafting "Mad Libs" programs as well as creating mini "Choose Your Own Adventure" stories. Over my lifetime, I've held the firm belief that computers should be easy to use and fun. These two principles are deeply interwoven and continue to guide my approach to crafting experiences for people on the web.

						I am comfortable operating across various contexts, from startups to corporate organizations. I've had the pleasure of riding the dot-com bubble and the equal displeasure of experiencing the bubble burst and crashing down to earth. I’ve pursued roles I never expected, spanning technical support, software testing, and development. Drawing on these experiences, I've acquired the institutional knowledge to design systems that simplify and enhance work for those in each stage of the software development lifecycle.

					<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
						I believe mistakes are some of the most valuable learning opportunities, leading to the greatest growth. I believe that things worth doing are hard. Throughout each stage of my career, I've been fortunate to work with people who have served as mentors and guides. Their guidance has shaped not just my technical skills, but also my approach to collaboration and problem-solving. I strive to be that person for others.

						Outside of work, I'm a dog dad to the sweetest Frenchie, Jojo. In my free time, I like to work on my FJ Cruiser, whether it's wrenching or modifying it for overland adventures. I enjoy driving the less-traveled roads, exploring the backcountry, popping up the tent, and doing some late-night stargazing. It helps balance my work/life by providing some much-needed solitude and a chance for reflection.
